                Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Bengali: শেখ মুজিবুর রহমান; Bengali pronunciation: [Shekh Mujibur Rôhman]) (17
                March 1920 – 15 August 1975) was the founding leader of Bangladesh. He served twice as the country's
                President and was its strongman premier between 1972 and 1975. Rahman was the leader of the Awami
                League. He is popularly known as the Bangabandhu (Friend of Bengal). His daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajed is
                the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh. He is credited as the central figure in Bangladesh's
                liberation movement and has been compared with many populist founding fathers of the 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was born in Tungipara, a village in Gopalganj District in the province
                of Bengal in British India,[3] to Sheikh Lutfur Rahman, a serestadar, an officer responsible for
                record-keeping at the Gopalganj civil court. He was born into a native Bengali family as the third child
                in a family of four daughters and two sons. In 1929, Mujib entered into class three at Gopalganj Public
                School, and two years later, class four at Madaripur Islamia High School.However, Mujib withdrew from
                school in 1934 to undergo eye surgery, and returned to school only after four years, owing to the
                severity of the surgery and slow recovery.At the age of eighteen, Mujib married Sheikh Fazilatunnesa
                Mujib. Together they had two daughters—Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana—and three sons—Sheikh Kamal,
                Sheikh Jamal, and Sheikh Rasel.

            Mujib left the Muslim League to join Suhrawardy, Maulana Bhashani and Yar Mohammad Khan in the formation of
            the Awami Muslim League, the predecessor of the Awami League. He was elected joint secretary of its East
            Bengal unit in 1949. While Suhrawardy worked to build a larger coalition of East Bengali and socialist
            parties, Mujib focused on expanding the grassroots organisation.[citation needed] In 1953, he was made the
            party's general secretary, and elected to the East Bengal Legislative Assembly on a United Front coalition
            ticket in 1954.[citation needed] Serving briefly as the minister for agriculture during A. K. Fazlul Huq's
            government, Mujib was briefly arrested for organising a protest of the central government's decision to
            dismiss the United Front ministry.
        </p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Following Suhrawardy's death in 1963, Mujib came to head the Awami League, which became one of the
                largest political parties in Pakistan.[citation needed] The party had dropped the word "Muslim" from its
                name in a shift towards secularism and a broader appeal to non-Muslim communities. Mujib was one of the
                key leaders to rally opposition to President Ayub Khan's Basic Democracies plan, the imposition of
                martial law and the one-unit scheme, which centralised power and merged the provinces.[11] Working with
                other political parties, he supported opposition candidate Fatima Jinnah against Ayub Khan in the 1964
                election. Mujib was arrested two weeks before the election, charged with sedition and jailed for a
                year.[9] In these years, there was rising discontent in East Pakistan over the atrocities committed by
                the Pakistani Armed Forces against Bengalis and the neglect of the issues and needs of East Pakistan by
                the ruling regime.[12] Despite forming a majority of the population, the Bengalis were poorly
                represented in Pakistan's civil services, police and military.[citation needed] There were also
                conflicts between the allocation of revenues and taxation.[citation needed] The 1965 war between India
                and Pakistan also revealed the markable vulnerability of East Pakistan compared to West Pakistan.

                Unrest over continuing denial of democracy spread across Pakistan and Mujib intensified his opposition
                to the disbandment of provinces. In 1966, Mujib proclaimed a 6-point plan titled Our Charter of Survival
                at a national conference of opposition political parties at Lahore,[3] in which he demanded
                self-government and considerable political, economic and defence autonomy for East Pakistan in a
                Pakistani federation with a weak central government.[11] According to his plan:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense on the Lahore
                    Resolution and the parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a legislature directly elected
                    on the basis of universal adult franchise.
                </li>
                <li>The federal government should deal with only two subjects: defence and foreign affairs, and all
                    other residuary subjects shall be vested in the federating states.
                </li>
                <li>Two separate, but freely convertible currencies for two wings should be introduced; or if this is
                    not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional
                    provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Pakistan.
                    Furthermore, a separate banking reserve should be established and separate fiscal and monetary
                    policy be adopted for East Pakistan.
                </li>
                <li>The power of taxation and revenue collection shall be vested in the federating units and the federal
                    centre will have no such power. The federation will be entitled to a share in the state taxes to
                    meet its expenditures.
                </li>
                <li>There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the
                    foreign exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in
                    a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the
                    constitution should empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries.
                </li>
                <li>East Pakistan should have a separate militia or paramilitary forces.</li>
